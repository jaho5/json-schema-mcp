# JSON Schemas Directory

This directory stores JSON schema files created with the MCP server.

Each schema is saved as a separate JSON file with the schema ID as the filename.

## Schema Structure

Schemas follow the JSON Schema specification and typically include:
- `$id`: Unique identifier for the schema
- `title`: Human-readable name
- `type`: Schema type (object, array, string, etc.)
- `properties`: Property definitions for object schemas
- `required`: List of required properties
